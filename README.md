## About
Local Mini-Racers is a school project about **controlling RC-Cars with a website**. 
### The concept 
Our idea is to create **an online platform where you can pair your car** with the password that the car displays on an tiny LCD panel. Once the pairing process ended, you can select your car on the platform and **drive it from your computer like a video game**, with controllers or steering wheel.
### Languages 
For this project we will use **NodeJS** and **Raspberry Pi** with **ejs** for templating and **mysql** for our database.
